# pySuite

## A not very good suite of tools in Python3
###### Also a test with Atom's git features, but that's less important :)

## Features:
- more than 0 script(s)
- not super useful script(s)
- next to no commits (yo what's up -committer)

#### Installation never coming. Ever. You don't need it. Seriously. Well, maybe. Also, I don't really know how to make a good install script that doesn't just add hundreds of aliases just for each script, so there won't be one
#### Licensed under the MIT license. (jk lmao)
