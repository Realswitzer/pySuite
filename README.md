# pySuite

## A not very good suite of tools in Python3
###### Also a test with Atom's git features, but that's less important :)

## Features:
- more than 0 script(s)
- not super useful script(s)
- next to no commits

#### Installation maybe coming soon? I don't really know how to make a good install script that doesn't just add hundreds of aliases just for each script.
