This directory is intended for temporary files, changes, etc, as in "copy files
here and remove when unnecessary". Unless your PR needs something located here,
in which case, move it somewhere outside, as this will be ignored by Git. While
this is really unnecessary to make a directory for this, I guess it works --
like copying an old broken PR and going to merge that with the new code.
